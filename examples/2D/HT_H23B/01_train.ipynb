    "organoids using a secondary antibody conjugated to a 555 dye. The resulting image data not only had\n",
    "CTIP2+ nuclear staining (wanted signal), but also puncta that accumulated because of non-specific signal\n",
    "(i.e. undesired artifacts).\n",
    "Ideally, we could use MicroSplit to unmix the labeled nuclei (desired image content) and the undesired\n",
    "puncta (i.e. imaging artifacts). However, for this we would need training targets that contain only nuclei\n",
    "and others that contain only puncta, a requirement that the experimental setup of our colleagues does not\n",
    "permit. In Section 2.1, we introduce Training Mode II-b, the manual selection of image regions that show\n",
    "only the artifacts (puncta) or only the desired structures (the signal, in this example, nuclei). The selected\n",
    "image regions are then combined, just as in any Training Mode II experiment, and used to train a MicroSplit\n",
    "network. Since crops without puncta or crops that show only puncta are of limited size with respect to full\n",
    "microscopy images (the smallest crops we collected were 100 → 100 pixels), lateral contextualization (LC;\n",
    "see Figure 2a) could not be used and was therefore disabled during training. In total, we have manually\n",
    "cropped 82 content regions and 48 puncta regions from the data. This led to a total of 53.7M pixels for\n",
    "training and took an analyst about eight hours of focused work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we assume that images of each single structure exist, but we no longer assume that all structures have\n",
    "been imaged in each sample. As before, here we also generate superimposed inputs by summing images showing different fluorescent structures. However, unlike before, summed-up input images no longer originate\n",
